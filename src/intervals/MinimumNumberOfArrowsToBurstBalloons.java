 * 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
 *
 * There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space.
 * For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter.
 * Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice.
 * Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.
 *
 * An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis.
 * A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart â‰¤ x â‰¤ xend.
 * There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely.
 * The problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
