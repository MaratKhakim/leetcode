 *
 * Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer)
 * of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 *
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
 * "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
 * and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
